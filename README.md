# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The motivation was to not forget the important information I have learned during the three modules. I build this project in order to create a website that will store and organize all the notes I've taken throughout the prework lessons. It solved my issue of figuring out how and where I wanted to take notes during this course that will allow for me to go back and review everything. Creating this website I have learned that there is so much more that comes to creating a website than just using HTML as I was briefly taught in my programming and concepts class.
